A continual problem is the storage of classified plaintext information on laptop computers in the United States and British governments. All major agencies have had more than one instance of laptops that contain classified information stolen from employees. Unfortunately, in most cases proper laptop disk encryption procedures were either not employed or not yet improved before the thefts occurred. As a result, potentially sensitive information in plaintext form was exposed to unauthorized personnel.
